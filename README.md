# PhotoOrganiser

A project to organise images and movies into appropriate 'Year', 'Month' and optional 'Day' folders using the date it was taken.
Also has a "flatten" feature that does the opposite.

Good for organising holiday or life event images.

Currently supports HEIC and JPG images, but plan to include a more varied range of files.
